# HaloPSA

Starting this off with a C# Azure Function App that syncs the device name fields to the asset tag with customer id as a prefix. 

It runs once every hour, change 60 to a different amount on line 62 if needed.

-Change values with your own Halo API & Instance

-Deploy SyncAssetsTags.cs with Visual Studio Community to a Azure Function App (consumption plan is ok).

-Enjoy the search results!
